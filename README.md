# Brew & Beans - Coffee Shop Website

Overview
- A complete, responsive, Tailwind CSS-based website for a coffee shop.
- Four pages: Home (index.html), About (about.html), Menu (menu.html), Contact (contact.html).
- Uses category-driven design guidelines (coffee shop) with: fonts Montserrat + Open Sans, color scheme centered around a rich coffee-brown palette, and modern, minimal layout.

Files included
- index.html: Home landing page with hero, highlights, and gallery.
- about.html: Brand story, philosophy, and imagery.
- menu.html: Beverage and pastry menu with prices.
- contact.html: Contact form and store directions.
- README.md: This document.

Key Design Notes
- All pages are built with Tailwind CSS classes only (inline styles used only for background images as described).
- Font imports include Montserrat for headings and Open Sans for body text via Google Fonts.
- Hero sections use a full-bleed background image placeholder with a dark overlay for readability.
- Images use descriptive alt text, and all navigation links are internal.
- Content is production-ready with realistic names, items, and descriptions.

Notes
- This is a complete initial build for a coffee shop website. You can extend with additional pages (e.g., gallery, events) by following the same pattern and updating the navigation accordingly.
